                <h10> 
                  Wildlife trade refers to the commerce of non-domesticated animals or plants, usually extracted from their natural
                   environment or raised under controlled conditions, either as living or dead animals or their body parts.
                   Illegal wildlife trafficking is any environment-related crime that involves the illegal trade, smuggling, poaching, capture or 
                   collection of endangered species, protected wildlife (including animals and plants that are subject to harvest quotas and regulated
                    by permits), derivatives or products thereof.
                    At the core of the illegal wildlife trafficking is a strong and rapidly expanding demand for a variety of products 
                    around the world: bushmeat; ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine; exotic pets; jewelry, trinkets, and 
                    accessories such as chess sets; furs for uses ranging from coats to traditional costumes; and trophies.
                    Wildlife trade is regulated by the United Nations' Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
                    Fauna and Flora (CITES), which currently has 170 member countries.
                    Illegal wildlife trade, however, is a widespread and serious conservation problem, it has a negative effect
                     on the viability of many wildlife populations and is one of the major threats to the survival of vertebrate
                      species.

                  <p>As human populations have grown, so has the demand for wildlife. People in many countries are accustomed to a 
                    lifestyle which fuels demand for wildlife. They expect access to a variety of seafoods, leather goods, timbers, 
                    medicinal ingredients and textiles. At the other end, extreme poverty means some people see wildlife as valuable
                    barter for trade.</p>

                      Rhino horn, elephant ivory and tiger products continue to command high prices among consumers, especially in Asia.
                      In Vietnam, the recent myth that rhino horn can cure cancer has led to massive poaching in South Africa and pushed
                      the price of rhino horn to rival gold.</p> 
                    <p> GAPS IN PROTECTION</p> 
                  <p> Corruption, toothless laws, weak judicial systems and light sentences allow criminal networks to keep plundering 
                    wildlife with little regard to consequences. These factors make illegal wildlife trade a low risk business with high
                     returns.
